# Changelog
#------------------------------
# General
- Backsteps now follow a proper pattern: < 30 = backflip, 30 to 70 = quick backstep, 70 to 100 = slow backstep, > 100 = stagger. Made this consistent across all the hold positions.

# Companions
- You can now only summon one companion at any one time.
- Adjusted the strength of the companions so they are more equal, and implemented map-specific scaling for all of them. This means they will hit harder in later levels.

# Catalysts
- Insanity Catalyst has slightly more scaling, only requires 50 INT/FTH.
- Fool's Flame now scales with Luck.
- Jester's Talisman now scales with Luck.
- Changed the damage affinity system. Rather than reducing the other types, it simply gives the main type an early boost.
- Changed the spells to take into account any scaling from a catalyst. This means spell buff will remain consistent across different spells.
- Hybrid catalysts now retain their school casting setup whilst infused (i.e. they don't lose or gain new schools). The change to the correction on spells means it doesn't matter if the catalyst only has INT and casts Miracles, the miracle will use the INT for its damage (before it wouldn't).

# Weapons
- Crystal Ring Shield now custom WA: Unleash Moonlight. A shield strike that emits a moonlight wave that reduces the magic absorption of targets hit by 5% for 8 seconds (stacks).

# Armor
- Added Gough's Set: sold by the Shrine Handmaid after defeating the Lordran Remnants.
- Added Crimson Set: found in Profaned Capital.
- Added Channeler Set: purchased from the Vinheim Scholars covenant / dropped by Quintus the Monstrous.
- Added Astrologist Set: found in Grand Archives (split across two chests).
- Added Aurous Set: dropped by Gaius the Mighty.

# Spells
- Adjusted the FP/damage of a few spells.
- Dark Bead now has a more random spread and delayed tracking.
- Bursting Fireball no longer drops pools of lava, rather additional fireballs are emitted whilst ascended.
- Cleaned up how damage is dealt by various spells (i.e. removed several secondary hits.
- Lightning Spear spells now deal big stamina and poise damage with their melee portion.
- Increased the base damage of Pyromancies/Dark Pyromancies to account for the need to invest in two stats for proper effectiveness.

# Rings
- Ring of Momentum now applies quickstep to the roll action, replacing normal rolls.

# Enemies
- Reduced the lock-on range increase to 25 (was 100). This will keep the extended range intended but reduce the silly instances of being able to target stuff from absurdly far away.
- Increased the damage of enemies in early levels.
- Increased defence multiplier for enemies in levels.
- Changed Quintus the Monstrous character setup.
- Changed Gaius the Mighty character setup.
- Renamed Lord Erectus to Lord Zakar (:wink:), changed his character setup. Now drops the Mad Warrior Set.
- Renamed Ezekiel to Ezekiel the Duelist.
- Reduced the absorption of the Lordran Remnants bosses.

# Items
- Ragged Mask is now part of the Swordmaster's drop.
- Swapped the Path of the Dragon gesture treasures in Archdragon Peak: using it at the Dragon Altar now gives you the Dragon Chaser's Ashes.
- Giant Set, Giant Halberd and Giant Shield are now found in the Darkmoon Tomb.
- Ring of Betrothal is now found on the Blacksmith Giant's body.
- Moved Black Metal Hat to a corpse treasure.

# Bugfixes
- Fixed an issue with some curses breaking weapon override effects.
- Fixed issue with script check causing companions to be visible at map transitions.
- Fixed bug with normal Priest's Candlestick not having the ascension effect.
- Issue with Hawkwood's quest checking for the Twinkling Dragon Torso stone should now fixed (it just checks if the player has received the item from the Path of the Gesture puzzle now).
- Fixed bugged chest in Profaned Capital.
- Fixed numerous small bugs.
