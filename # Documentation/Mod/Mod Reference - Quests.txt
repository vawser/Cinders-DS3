Greirat:
 First Assignment: Undead Settlement
    Steal trinket from patrolling Peasant
        
    Dialogue:
        <initial>
        My dear Loretta... Her trinket meant so much to her.
        It pains me that one of those foul peasants of the settlement took it.
        Please, return this trinket to me.
        But be careful, it is fragile, so I recommend you obtain it my stealth.
        A quick burrow into the peasant's pockets will do.

        <return>
        Ahh! The trinket! Thank you for this service.
        May I teach you a little of the art of thievery?
        In return for this act of loyalty.

    Reward:
        Stick to the Shadows
            Reduces enemy sight by 10%

 Second Assignment: Irithyll
    Steal trinket from patrolling Pontiff Knight
    
    Dialogue:
        <initial>
        Ahh, hello, fine work, I say.  Discovering Irithyll in the Boreal Valley, all in a day's work.
        If the tales are true, it is home to old moon-worshipping nobles, and should be packed with treasure.  
        In fact, I have heard that one of the knights possess a valuable trinket.
        If you were to acquire such a trinket, I would be willing to teach you more about the art of thievery.
        I believe your target is known to patrol the main cathedral, above their fallen pontiff.
         
        <return>
        Ah, yes. What a wonderful trinket indeed.
        As promised, I shall teach you more about the art of thievery.
         
    Reward:
        Feather Step
            Reduces enemy listen by 10%
            
            
  Third Assignment: Lothric Castle
    Steal Urn trinket from patrolling Lothric Knight
  
    Dialogue:
        <initial>
        Rumour has it, Lothric Castle is home to a divine urn.
        Such a treasure shouldn't be left in the hands of those blasted knights.
        Enter the castle, and retrieve the urn.
        But be warned, the castle is a death trap, and not a single man has returned from the castle unscathed.
        
        <return>
        Hello. What a beautiful urn. But upon closer inspection, it looks to be little more than a decoration.
        Here, you keep it. I'm sure you can find a use for such a thing.
        
    Reward:
        Awards Gwynevere's Urn

Road of Sacrifices:
    Progression:
        Speak to Anri. Exhaust dialogue

    Dialogue:
        Oh, hello. How do you do.
        I am Anri of Astora. Unkindled, like you.
        This is Horace. A friend and travelling companion.
        Are you too in search of the Lords of Cinder?
        We are well along the road of sacrifices. Below us is the Crucifixion Woods.
        Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep, home of the Undead Legion. Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep.
        We seek the cathedral, home of the grim Aldrich.
        We may go our separate ways now, but we are both seekers of lords.
        The next time we cross paths, one may find the other in a time of need.
        May the flames guide your way.

        Oh, yes, Horace…
        He's not very talkative.
        But don't think ill of him. He's an upstanding, kind-hearted knight, a fine partner for this gruelling journey.
        Without his help, I would have cursed this onerous duty long ago.
