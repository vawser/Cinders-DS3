# Fog Walls
#------------------------------------
Boss Fogwalls have a special piece of collision using hit filter 20 that must be placed below the fogwall object so it can be used, otherwise the prompt will not appear.

To add new:
 Fogwall object [Object]
 Fogwall collision piece (normally horizontal) [Collison]
 Boss start area [Event]
 NPC collision piece (normally vertical) [Collison]
 In scripts, add new common fogwall events (follow FROM's pattern)

#------------------------------------
# Generators

Using ForceCharacterDeath on an enemy used in a generator that is disabled will cause the enemy to bug out when spawned.
Use a SpEffect to kill instead, as that cannot affect disabled enemies.

# Adding new Enemies
#------------------------------------
Copy the enemy entry across from source map to target map. 
Copy the model definition entry across from source map to target map.

If enemy has common AI, should work fine. Otherwise lua needs to edited for the map in script folder.

To do this find the right luabnd, yabber it and then add the wanted _battle.lua to the the script/ai/out/bin folder (from the luabnd containing it). Edit the luagnl (yabber it), adding the constants used by the _battle.lua. Then add the _battle.lua to the yabber manifest file and repack the luabnd.

#------------------------------------
# Bonfire
#------------------------------------
Need to move:
 Object (under Objects tab)
 Chr (under Enemies tab)
 Player (under Players tab)
 Spawnpoint (under SpawnPoints tab)
 
The Chr needs to be lower than the bonfire for the interaction to work correctly.
