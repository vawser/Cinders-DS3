Cinders requires a custom version of the randomiser, so to use the Item Randomiser with Cinders, drag and drop the files within this directory in to the DARK SOULS III/Game/ directory.

Use the AoBRandomsier.exe to generate new seeds, use New and then Custom List, entering a number bigger than 1900 (the number needs to be atleast the number of lines in Data_Item_List, bigger just ensures that is the case). 

Copy the contents of DS3RandomAoB.txt into Data_Item_Order.txt.
