# List of directories that contain modded files in order of prioritization. Inside each specified mod directory must have the game
# assets in Fromsoft's asset structure. I.e. if you mod parts/something.partsbnd.dcx, the modded version must be at mod/parts/something.partsbnd.dcx.
# Absolute paths to mods are supported but must use '\\' to separate path items. For example, if your mod is at E:\coolstuff\coolmod, you must enter
# the path in the config as "E:\\coolstuff\\coolmod".
# If there's no drive specifier (C:, D:, etc), the path is relative to where the launcher is located. For example, having the path as "mod" will tell
# modengine 2 to look for the directory mod inside the mod engine 2 directory with the launcher.
#
# Multiple mods must be separated with commas. For example if you have 3 mods, you will have something like the following:
# mods = [
#    { enabled = true, name = "coolmod", path = "mod1" },
#    { enabled = true, name = "nicemod", path = "mod2" },
#    { enabled = true, name = "sosomod", path = "mod3" }
# ]
# Note that modengine 2 currently has no way to resolve conflicting files including regulation.bin, and thus the mod with the highest priority
# will have the modded file be loaded in the case of conflict. Some support for merging of params and potentially other assets is considered for
# a future release.

    { enabled = true, name = "Mod", path = "Cinders" }

# When enabled, scylly hide will be injected into the game. This allows for antidebug measures in the game to be bypassed so that you can attach
# debuggers such as Cheat Engine, x64dbg, windbg, etc to the game without as much trouble. If you're not reverse engineering the game, this option
# is probably not for you.
