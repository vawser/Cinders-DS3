# Notes
#----------------------------------------
You'll need to create a vanilla save game before installing Cinders.
(Only needed the first time you install this mod. Not affected by updates) 
Without doing this, you'll get the "Save Data is Corrupted" message.

This mod only works if your game is in english (This can be done by changing the main language of Steam)
~ Settings -> Interface -> Select english

Recommended to move your save files (type %appdata%/DarkSoulsIII in your PC) elsewhere if you
don't want to lose your unmoded saves.

#----------------------------------------
# Installation
#----------------------------------------
Extract the contents of the Setup zip file into the folder you want to store the Cinders mod in.
Extract the contents of the Main and Model zip files into the folder you want to store the Cinders mod in.
Click the launchmod_darksouls3.bat to launch the mod.

If updating an old installation, you need to:
 - Delete the DarkSouls3.exe
 - Delete the dinput8.dll
 - Delete the old HoodiePatcher.dll and HoodiePatcher.ini 
 - Verify the game through Steam.

#----------------------------------------
Uninstallation
#----------------------------------------
Delete the folder you extracted the Setup, Main and Model zip files into.
